Originally, I wanted to create a different tutorial called, \"The Absolute Best and Most Mind Blowing Tutorial You've Ever Heard Of in Regards to Data Science.\" It was going to be descriptive, informative, and it was going to blow your socks off with data lazers and be nothing short of award-winning. But that's, like, way too much work. And also we have to tread lightly around new data scientists because they're like squirrels and run away if you move too fast.\n\n![Data Squirrel](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IyitCtDpBafoAbm/giphy.gif)\n<br><br>\n\nMy main goal is to get you involved with the wonderful Kaggle community by getting you into analysis mode right away. Kernel notebooks are a great tool for this because I can type a bunch of jibberish here and you can 'fork' (aka copy) this kernel and build upon my jibberish with your own jibberish! This isn't the kind of tutorial that will make you a pro after reading it. But at the very least, you'll make bargraphs and then who knows? Maybe you print them out and put them on your grandmother's refrigerator or something. Maybe you set up a booth at a data science convention and sell highly-desirable *autographed* versions of your bargraphs.

Examine the data\n2. Create some hypotheses about the data \n3. Test the hypotheses\n4. Report your results\n<br><br>\n\nThis tutorial is all about #1, examining the data.  We are going to examine the hell out of this data. We're going to examine the data then make sweet bar graphs about the data. So how do we examine data? You may be surprised to learn that examining data can be accomplished by looking at,  gazing upon, or poking around the data. When we're poking around our data, it's called an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which is literally a fancy phrase for looking at data. While looking at data, you look for relationships and trends (fancy words for lines) to form hypotheses. Data science is all about lines and I personally start foaming at the mouth when I see lines in data. You may or may not also foam at the mouth, it's unclear if thats normal or not.\n<br><br>\n\n\nAnd moving on...\n\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cwP0Meo.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: right; padding: 0 0 0 0;\"> \n\nPart of an exploratory data analysis means we need to learn about the rows and columns (aka dimensions) of the dataframe.  If you had never heard of soccer before, you'd probably want to know how far the field was from end to end. That's a terrible example, but still it's fundamentally helpful to get a sense of how \"long\" and \"wide\" your datafame is. \n\nThis AMAZING DATA VIZ that I created to the right is 3 wide x 3 long, meaning it has 3 rows and 3 columns.\n\nThe rows are labeled: \n* Strikers\n* Midfield\n* Defense\n<br><br>\n\nThe columns are labeled: \n* Left field\n* Center\n* Right field\n<br><br>\n\n\nIf you've gotten this far in life, you probably already know all of that. So now that I've spent entirely too much time drawing and talking about what rows and columns are, let's actually learn about our dataframe's rows and columns... How many are there?\n\n\n\nIn order to get a quick check of the number of rows and columns in our actual dataframe, we can use the **shape** method like this:\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"1e25a48a2730a977138084981eec0316a76b7124","_cell_guid":"bd206193-c8cc-4a32-9257-ca347398c99c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"1ef6cb6f11e275d4208f2f3b40caa71d0bc12332","_cell_guid":"beec6740-8d61-4e64-941b-ee42a4f421d5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"174104 rows and  66 columns\n\n> Row then Column is generally how these things are reported. \n<br><br>\n\nThere are a ton of methods you can use on your dataframe while your exploring.
